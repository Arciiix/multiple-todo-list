# Multiple technologies TODO list

A simple TODO list app made with different front-end and back-end technologies.
The purpose is to compare the different aproaches to create such a simple application - and maybe see, how other technologies and programming languages work with each other.

# Things I focused on

## Front-end

- Data fetching
- State managment
- Styling (how easy it is to create custom css styles) + usage of the out-of-box UI libraries (Material based)
- Performance
- Routing
- Real-time data (sockets)
- Lazy loading

## Back-end

- Database - e.g. ORMs and how they work together with the framework
- Tools that provide some things out-of-box, e.g. JWT based authentication
- Amount of errors I have to go through (how easy they are to solve)
- Logging (how errors are logged)
- Amount of boilerplate code
- Time taken to write specific part of code
- Complexity
- WebSockets

# Technologies used

## Front-end

- React + TypeScript (not done yet)

## Back-end

- NestJS (Node.js) + Prisma + SQLite3 (not done yet)

# Personal feedback

That's the thing that inspired me the most to make this project come true. I will write my personal thoughts about each technology later here.
